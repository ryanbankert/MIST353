# MIST353 Assignment 2

This website aims to provide accurate climate change data along with a comprehensive and intuitive interface, allowing users to access information in an efficient and timely manner. This is currently in a rough prototype phase. Currently, the website is in the early stages with very minimal information. I plan to include a map of the world to pinpoint climate data to certain locations. 

From my research, a lot of climate information (datasets) are hard to find and inaccessible to the everyday user. There seems to be a lot more API integrations that can be used to integrate climate data to make it more accessible for the user. 

In the future, I plan to add integrations to said datasets, along with a page that will allow the user to pinpoint a specific global location and gather climate statistics from the inputted location.

**Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet**

This website provides basic information in an intuitive manner with more information regarding certain climate information behind a pop-up next to the statistics. I like this as it shows all the graphs and supporting data next to the information. They also use elements from w3 which is the website for specifications on web standards.

**Climate Change Dashboard**
https://climatedata.imf.org

This website provides a lot of information and data. However, it is not in an intuitive manner. I think this would be useful to use in research applications, but not so much for an end user wanting to receive information in an efficient and timely manner.

**IsEarthStillWarming**
https://IsEarthStillWarming.com

This website provides a lot of inspiration for my prototype as it has a lot of useful information. It is very clean & simple and includes a lot of information. Additionally, this website displays key information regarding climate change along with sources for scientific research. I enjoy seeing that the superscripts lead you to the specific citation using an anchor.

**Climate Change Data**

This GitHub repository seems promising as there are so many different dataset APIs and open-source projects related to Climate Change. There are many APIs in this repository that will be useful for implementation in this project. This includes their category, a link to their resource, and a brief description.

***Earth's Vital Signs***
https://github.com/gavin-bauer/earth-vital-signs?tab=readme-ov-file

Gavinâ€™s repository uses data from NASA and NOAA to see the evolution of surface temperatures, arctic sea ice concentrations, and carbon dioxide levels. This one is a little more basic as it just shows the three climate datasets. Their website looks good as it has a fog/haze floating over a glacier.
